Download Public Models
======================


This page provides instructions on how to use the *samples/download_public_models.sh* script to download 

   - `YOLO <https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/>`__
   - `CenterFace <https://github.com/Star-Clouds/CenterFace>`__
   - `HSEmotion <https://github.com/av-savchenko/face-emotion-recognition>`__
   - `Deeplabv3 <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/public/deeplabv3/README.md#deeplabv3>`__  models.

The script downloads the models from the respective sources, handles the necessary conversions, and places the model files in a directory specified by the MODELS_PATH environment variable.

Example for downloading YOLOv11s model:


.. code-block:: none

    export MODELS_PATH=/path/to/models

    ./samples/download_public_models.sh yolo11s

Quantization
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can perform INT8 quantization on some of the models by specifying a second parameter with a dataset to be used for the quantization process.

.. code-block:: none

    ./samples/download_public_models.sh yolo11s coco128

Currently available datasets are ``coco`` and ``coco128``.

.. note::
   ``coco`` is a very large dataset of over 20GB and containing more than a 100,000 images. Quantization on this dataset can take a very long time. For development purposes, it is recommended to use ``coco128`` instead which is much lighter.

Models which currently support quantization are:

   - YOLOv5: nu, su, mu, lu, xu, n6u, s6u, m6u, l6u, x6u
   - YOLOv8: n, s, m, l, x
   - YOLOV9: t, s, m, c, e
   - YOLOv10: n, s, m, b, l, x
   - YOLOv11: n, s, m, l, x
