Ubuntu advanced installation - prerequisites
============================================

To use GPU and/or NPU as an inference devices or to use graphics hardware encoding/decoding capabilities, it is required to install appropriate drivers.
The easiest way to install these drivers is to use automated script described in: :doc:`../../get_started/install/install_guide_ubuntu`.
This documentation describes how to do these steps manually.


Prerequisite 1 - Intel® GPU drivers for computing and media runtimes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To use GPU as an inference device or to use graphics hardware encoding/decoding capabilities, it is required to install GPU computing and media runtime drivers.
Please follow the up-to-date instruction according to your hardware:

-  For Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series and Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series:
   https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/client/overview.html

-  For Intel® Client and Arc™ GPUs:
   https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/installation.html


Prerequisite 2 - Install Intel® NPU drivers
-------------------------------------------

.. note::
   Optional step for Intel® Core™ Ultra processors

If you want to use NPU AI accelerator, you need to have Intel® NPU drivers installed.

A. Before installation, please make sure that intel_vpu.ko module is enabled on your host:

.. code:: sh

   user@your-host:~$ lsmod | grep intel_vpu
   intel_vpu             245760  0

B. Installing the driver requires the device to be recognized by your system - Kernel Mode driver should be available. It means you can see a ``accel`` device in ``/dev/dri`` directory. If you don't see it, please reboot the host.

   .. code:: sh

      user@my-host:~$ ll /dev/accel/ | grep accel
      crw-rw----  1 root render 261, 0   Aug  6 22:41 accel0

C. Install the newest Intel® NPU driver. Please follow 'Installation procedure' for the newest available driver version described in: https://github.com/intel/linux-npu-driver/releases

.. note::
   If you are experiencing issues with installation process, check all notes and tips in the release note for the newest Intel® NPU driver version: https://github.com/intel/linux-npu-driver/releases.
   Please pay attention to access to the device as a non-root user.

.. note::
   The following error can be reported when running Intel® DL Streamer on NPU device:

   .. code:: sh

      Setting pipeline to PLAYING ...
      New clock: GstSystemClock
      Caught SIGSEGV
      Spinning.

   In such case, please use the following setting as a temporary workaround:

   .. code:: sh

      export ZE_ENABLE_ALT_DRIVERS=libze_intel_vpu.so

   The issue should be fixed with newer versions of Intel® NPU drivers and Intel® OpenVINO™ NPU plugins.
