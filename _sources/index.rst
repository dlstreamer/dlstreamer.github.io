Intel® Deep Learning Streamer
=============================
**Intel® Deep Learning Streamer (Intel® DL Streamer)** is an open-source streaming media analytics framework, based on GStreamer* multimedia framework, for creating complex media analytics pipelines for the Cloud or at the Edge, and it includes:

*	`Intel® DL Streamer Pipeline Framework <https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/libraries/dl-streamer>`__ for designing, creating, building, and running media analytics pipelines. It includes C++ and Python APIs.
*	`Intel® DL Streamer Pipeline Server <https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server>`__ for deploying and scaling media analytics pipelines as micro-services on one or many compute nodes. It includes REST APIs for pipelines management.

**Media analytics** is the analysis of audio & video streams to detect, classify, track, identify and count objects, events and people. The analyzed results can be used to take actions, coordinate events, identify patterns and gain insights across multiple domains: retail store and events facilities analytics, warehouse and parking management, industrial inspection, safety and regulatory compliance, security monitoring, and many others.

**Media analytics pipelines** transform media streams into insights through audio / video processing, inference, and analytics operations across multiple IP blocks.

High-performance Media Analytics solutions are difficult to build, deploy, and benchmark:

*	Require deep expertise in multiple domains, including media processing and Deep Learning based AI inferencing frameworks and tools (e.g., FFmpeg*, GStreamer*, OpenCV*, OpenVINO™ toolkit, PyTorch*, TensorFlow*, ONNX*)
*	Require system level, SW, and HW expertise (e.g., fixed function HW, programmable media, host/accelerator buffer sharing, CPU Core & thread allocation, wide range of system configurations and their trade-offs)
*	Require expertise across CPU classes, SKUs, and their generations, in addition to expertise in integrated & discrete HW accelerators and their interactions with CPUs and rest of the host system (e.g., CPUs, integrated GPUs, discrete GPUs and VPUs)

**Intel® DL Streamer** makes **Media Analytics** easy:

*	Get better performance while writing less code
*	Quickly develop, optimize, benchmark, and deploy video & audio analytics pipelines in the Cloud and at the Edge
*	Analyze video & audio streams, create actionable results, capture, and send results to the cloud
*	Leverage the efficiency and computational power of Intel® hardware platforms
*	Write more portable code across Intel® hardware platforms, CPU & xPU classes and generations
*	Leverage GStreamer* open-source project community investments in new features & bug-fixes
*	Leverage NNStreamer* selected AI inferencing elements via pipeline inter-operability
*	Customize and extend your solution by reviewing, analyzing, and modifying Intel® DL Streamer open-sourced code
