gvametapublish
==============

Publishes the JSON metadata to MQTT or Kafka message brokers or files.
MQTT and Kafka methods offer reconnection in case a connection to the
broker is not established or is lost. During this reconnection time, any
metadata that passes through the element will not be cached or
published. It will simply pass through to the next element in the
pipeline.

.. warning::

    This element leverages TLS to ensure secure communication while sending MQTT messages. The paths to the necessary certificates and keys, included in the configuration file, are passed to the Paho Asynchronous MQTT C Client Library for establishing TLS connections. However, it is important to note that the storage, management, and protection of these certificates and keys are beyond the scope of this component.

    Key Points:
    * **Certificate and Key Handling:** The plugin passes the paths to the certificates and keys to the Paho library but does not handle their storage or protection.
    * **Responsibility:** The responsibility for securely storing and protecting the certificates and keys (ensuring confidentiality and integrity for private keys and integrity for public keys) lies with the external application or system that uses this element. Additionally, the external application is responsible for the generation, provisioning, and removal of keys, ensuring that these processes are conducted securely and in accordance with best practices.
    * **Security Measures:** It is recommended that the external application implements appropriate security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the cryptographic credentials.
