                          String. Default: null

                          Boolean. Default: false
    sliding-window      : Sliding window increment in seconds. Audio event detection is performed using a window of 1 second with an increment specified by the user. The default value of 1 implies no overlap between successive inferences. An increment value of 0.5 implies inference requests every 0.5 seconds with 0.5 seconds overlap
