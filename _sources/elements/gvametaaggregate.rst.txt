gvametaaggregate
================

Aggregates inference results from multiple pipeline branches. Data that
is transferred further along the pipeline is taken from the first sink
pad of the gvametaaggreagate element.

    min-upstream-latency: When sources with a higher latency are expected to be plugged in dynamically after the aggregator has started playing, this allows overriding the minimum latency reported by the initial source(s). This is only taken into account when larger than the actually reported minimum latency. (nanoseconds)
